## Problem: There are `n` houses in a village. We want to supply water for all the houses by building wells and laying pipes. For each house `i`, we can either build a well inside it directly with cost `wells[i-1]`, or pipe in water from another well to it. The costs to lay pipes between houses are given by the array `pipes` where each `pipes[j] = [house1, house2, cost]` represents the cost to connect `house1` and `house2` together using a pipe. Connections are bidirectional, and there could be multiple valid connections between the same two houses with different costs. Return *the minimum total cost to supply water to all houses.*

### Insights:

* Needs Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
  * Kruskal's (Disjoint Set, Uses Union-Find Data Structure)
    * Sorts edges in non-decreasing order
    * Pick minimum weight edges and add to MST solution
    * Compare both vertices
      * If both are in different subtrees, merge and remove one tree, add cost
      * If one is in a subtree and other is not, add to subtree, add cost
      * If neither are in a subtree, create a new subtree, add cost
      * Check if only one tree exists and if size equals to number of houses
      * Return cost
* Create a helper to find which subtree/set a vertex is in

Method/Function (minCostToSupplyWater):
    -Create an edges list, arraylist containing arrays of integers
    -Create a sets/subtree list, arraylist containing arraylists of int arrays
    -Create a cost variable to return

    -Populate edges list:
        -For int[] wells:
            -Create a for loop iterating(house) for length of wells array:
                -Create array variable to store {0, house + 1, wells[house]}, Creates a new node [0] which connects to all houses with an edge list of wells[house]
                -Add to edges list
        -For int[][]pipes:
            -For each loop and add to edges list
    
    -Sort edges arraylist by 2nd index (cost)

    -For each loop for every array in edges
        -Store the index of house1 (set[0]) is in edges (firstSetIndex)
        -Store the index of house2 (set[1]) is in edges (secondSetIndex)
        

        -If statement to check if both vertices are in different sets
            -Add all vertices in secondSetIndex to firstSetIndex
            -Remove secondSetIndex from sets
            -Increase cost by set[2]

        -If statement to check if both vertices are not in a set
            -Create a newSet variable
            -Create a tempSet containing both set[0] and set[1]
            -Add tempSet into newSet
            -Add newSet into sets
            -Increase cost by set[2]
        
        -(2x)If statement to check if one vertex is in a set and another isn't
            -Create a set containing both vertices
            -Add set to existing set containing vertex
            -Increase cost by set[2]

        -If statement to check if only one subtree exists and if size is equal to number of houses
            -Break if true
    
    -Return Cost

Method/Function(findIndex)
    -Parameters: target integer, sets arraylist
    -Returns: integer of sets index containing target variable, -1 if not found

    -For loop iterating through sets size
        -Get each set in sets.get(i)
        -For each loop for each array in set
            -For each loop for each number in each set:
                -Check if taget equals each number
                    -Return i if true
    
    -Return -1 if not found
