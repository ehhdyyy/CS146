## Problem: Given the `root` of a binary tree, return <i>the level order traversal of its nodes' values</i> (i.e., from left to right, level by level)

```
Notes: 
    - Returns a list of lists of integers 
    - Parameters: root 
    - Will be done recursively
    - Uses a queue 

Method/Function levelOrder:
    - Create a variable that holds the final list
    - Base Case: If root is null, return final list
    - Create a queue variable and add root to queue
    - While Loop (queue is not empty):
        - Initialize list variable holding int values
        - Initialize int variable equal to queue size, will be used to insert certain # of values into the list of integers
        - For loop (i < levelSize):
            - Create a variable that stores first node and removes said node from queue
            - Add the value of that node into the variable holding the list of integers
            - Check if node.left or node.right is not null, then add node into queue
        - Add the new list of integers into final list
    - Return final list
