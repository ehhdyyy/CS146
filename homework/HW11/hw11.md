## Problem: An image is represented by an `m x n` integer grid `image` where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. You should perform a <b>flood fill</b> on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`

```
Notes: 
    -Return the modified image after performing the flood fill
    -Can be done with a queue/stack or recursively
    -Parameters: 2D Int Array, sr (Starting row), sc (Starting column), color

Method/Function (floodFill) Recursive Approach:
    -Start with base case, if start pixel equals color, no changes will be made
    -Created a helper method and called it here, has extra parameter called initialColor, stores the color/# from first method
        -Base Case: Checks if current pixel is within boundaries of row and column and if color is the same as the starting pixel
            -If not return
        -Change the pixel color to the initialColor
        -Recursively call 4-directional pixels by incrementing or decrementing only either sr or sc by 1.
    -In the original method, return the modified image

```
