### Time Complexity Analysis for ***Insertion Sort***: Worst Case: O(n^2)
Insertion sort has a while loop that moves a key to their sorted position inside a for loop that iterates for the length of the array. n^2 when array is in decending order


### Time Complexity Analysis for Performing Matrix Multiplication: Worst Case O(n^3)
This psuedocode has a for loop in a for loop in a for loop. This will make the time complexity be: n * n * n
